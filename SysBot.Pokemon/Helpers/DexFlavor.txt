It dissolves and eats metal. Circulating liquid metal within its body is how it generates energy.
At the end of its life-span, Melmetal will rust and fall apart. The small shards left behind will eventually be reborn as Meltan.
When it uses its special stick to strike up a beat, the sound waves produced carry revitalizing energy to the plants and flowers in the area.
The faster a Thwackey can beat out a rhythm with its two sticks, the more respect it wins from its peers.
By drumming, it taps into the power of its special tree stump. The roots of the stump follow its direction in battle.
A warm-up of running around gets fire energy coursing through this Pokémon’s body. Once that happens, it’s ready to fight at full power.
Its thick and fluffy fur protects it from the cold and enables it to use hotter fire moves.
It juggles a pebble with its feet, turning it into a burning soccer ball. Its shots strike opponents hard and leave them scorched.

A clever combatant, this Pokémon battles using water balloons created with moisture secreted from its palms.
It has many hidden capabilities, such as fingertips that can shoot water and a membrane on its back that it can use to glide through the air.
Found throughout the Galar region, this Pokémon becomes uneasy if its cheeks are ever completely empty of berries.
It stashes berries in its tail—so many berries that they fall out constantly. But this Pokémon is a bit slow-witted, so it doesn’t notice the loss.

This Pokémon reigns supreme in the skies of the Galar region. The black luster of its steel body could drive terror into the heart of any foe.
A constant collector of information, this Pokémon is very smart. Very strong is what it isn’t.
It barely moves, but it’s still alive. Hiding in its shell without food or water seems to have awakened its psychic powers.
It’s famous for its high level of intelligence, and the large size of its brain is proof that it also possesses immense psychic power.
Aided by the soft pads on its feet, it silently raids the food stores of other Pokémon. It survives off its ill-gotten gains.
It secretly marks potential targets with a scent. By following the scent, it stalks its targets and steals from them when they least expect it.
It anchors itself in the ground with its single leg, then basks in the sun. After absorbing enough sunlight, its petals spread as it blooms brilliantly.
The seeds attached to its cotton fluff are full of nutrients. It spreads them on the wind so that plants and other Pokémon can benefit from them.
Its curly fleece is such an effective cushion that this Pokémon could fall off a cliff and stand right back up at the bottom, unharmed.

Apparently the itch of its teething impels it to snap its jaws at anything in front of it.

Most of its body has the same composition as coal. Fittingly, this Pokémon was first discovered in coal mines about 400 years ago.
It forms coal inside its body. Coal dropped by this Pokémon once helped fuel the lives of people in the Galar region.
It’s usually peaceful, but the vandalism of mines enrages it. Offenders will be incinerated with flames that reach 2,700 degrees Fahrenheit.
It spends its entire life inside an apple. It hides from its natural enemies, bird Pokémon, by pretending it’s just an apple and nothing more.
It ate a sour apple, and that induced its evolution. In its cheeks, it stores an acid capable of causing chemical burns.
Eating a sweet apple caused its evolution. A nectarous scent wafts from its body, luring in the bug Pokémon it preys on.
As it digs, it swallows sand and stores it in its neck pouch. The pouch can hold more than 17 pounds of sand.
When it contracts its body, over 220 pounds of sand sprays from its nose. If it ever runs out of sand, it becomes disheartened.
It’s so strong that it can knock out some opponents in a single hit, but it also may forget what it’s battling midfight.
If it sees any movement around it, this Pokémon charges for it straightaway, leading with its sharply pointed jaw. It’s very proud of that jaw.

When this Pokémon sounds as if it’s strumming a guitar, it’s actually clawing at the protrusions on its chest to generate electricity.

When it heats up, its body temperature reaches about 1,500 degrees Fahrenheit. It lashes its body like a whip and launches itself at enemies.
It’s very curious, but its means of investigating things is to try to punch them with its tentacles. The search for food is what brings it onto land.
A body made up of nothing but muscle makes the grappling moves this Pokémon performs with its tentacles tremendously powerful.
This Pokémon is said to have been born when a lonely spirit possessed a cold, leftover cup of tea.
This species lives in antique teapots. Most pots are forgeries, but on rare occasions, an authentic work is found.
Via the protrusion on its head, it senses other creatures’ emotions. If you don’t have a calm disposition, it will never warm up to you.
No matter who you are, if you bring strong emotions near this Pokémon, it will silence you violently.
It emits psychic power strong enough to cause headaches as a deterrent to the approach of others.
Through its nose, it sucks in the emanations produced by people and Pokémon when they feel annoyed. It thrives off this negative energy.

With the hair wrapped around its body helping to enhance its muscles, this Pokémon can overwhelm even Machamp.
Its voice is staggering in volume. Obstagoon has a tendency to take on a threatening posture and shout—this move is known as Obstruct.

When it trusts a Trainer, it will treat them to berries it’s decorated with cream.
Five of them are troopers, and one is the brass. The brass’s orders are absolute.
It feeds on seaweed, using its teeth to scrape it off rocks. Electric current flows from the tips of its spines.
It spits out thread imbued with a frigid sort of energy and uses it to tie its body to branches, disguising itself as an icicle while it sleeps.
Icy scales fall from its wings like snow as it flies over fields and mountains. The temperature of its wings is less than −290 degrees Fahrenheit.
It stands in grasslands, watching the sun’s descent from zenith to horizon. This Pokémon has a talent for delivering dynamic kicks.
It drifted in on the flow of ocean waters from a frigid place. It keeps its head iced constantly to make sure it stays nice and cold.
It uses the horns on its head to sense the emotions of others. Males will act as valets for those they serve, looking after their every need.
As it eats the seeds stored up in its pocket-like pouches, this Pokémon is not just satisfying its constant hunger. It’s also generating electricity.
It digs up the ground with its trunk. It’s also very strong, being able to carry loads of over five tons without any problem at all.
They came over from another region long ago and worked together with humans. Their green skin is resistant to water.
In ancient times, it was unbeatable thanks to its powerful lower body, but it went extinct anyway after it depleted all its plant-based food sources.
The shaking of its freezing upper half is what generates its electricity. It has a hard time walking around.
Powerful legs and jaws made it the apex predator of its time. Its own overhunting of its prey was what drove it to extinction.
Though it’s able to capture prey by freezing its surroundings, it has trouble eating the prey afterward because its mouth is on top of its head.
Its body resembles polished metal, and it’s both lightweight and strong. The only drawback is that it rusts easily.
After being reborn as a ghost Pokémon, Dreepy wanders the areas it used to inhabit back when it was alive in prehistoric seas.
It’s capable of flying faster than 120 mph. It battles alongside Dreepy and dotes on them until they successfully evolve.
When it isn’t battling, it keeps Dreepy in the holes on its horns. Once a fight starts, it launches the Dreepy like supersonic missiles.
Known as a legendary hero, this Pokémon absorbs metal particles, transforming them into a weapon it uses to battle.
In times past, it worked together with a king of the people to save the Galar region. It absorbs metal that it then uses in battle.
The core on its chest absorbs energy emanating from the lands of the Galar region. This energy is what allows Eternatus to stay active.
Kubfu trains hard to perfect its moves. The moves it masters will determine which form it takes when it evolves.
This form of Urshifu is a strong believer in the one-hit KO. Its strategy is to leap in close to foes and land a devastating blow with a hardened fist.
Within dense forests, this Pokémon lives in a pack with others of its kind. It’s incredibly aggressive, and the other Pokémon of the forest fear it.

Glastrier emits intense cold from its hooves. It’s also a belligerent Pokémon—anything it wants, it takes by force.
